   <p id="happy-tree">We don't have anything but happy trees here. Every day I learn. Just make a decision and let it go. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.</p>
    </div>

   <p>There we go. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Working it up and down, back and forth. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.</p>

    <p>There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. There he comes. Learn when to stop. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun.</p>

    <p>That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Take your time. Speed will come later. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.</p>

    <p>All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Here we're limited by the time we have. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.</p>

    <p>You can spend all day playing with mountains. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.</p>

    <p>Trees cover up a multitude of sins. A happy cloud. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.</p>
